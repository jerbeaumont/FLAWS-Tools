## Description

The FLAWS-Tools software implements the image reconstruction methods described in (1-3) for FLAWS multi-contrast imaging.

The permanent citable DOI link to the original source code used in the production of this paper is here: LINK TO THE DOI ONCE OBTAINED. 

This software has been developed by a team of researchers from [CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/)'s [The Australian E-Health Research Centre](http://aehrc.com/) and from the [LTSI](www.ltsi.univ-rennes1.fr). See AUTHORS.txt for more details.

## Requirements

- Git
- CMake (>= 3.1.0)
- A linux environment (the compilation on OSX and Windows environment has not been tested and is not guaranteed by the developers)

## Third party components

FLAWS-Tools are built using CMake. In addition, it depends on two other libraries:

- The Insight Toolkit, with powerful pipelining, multithreading and
  medical image IO/manipulation routines, and large helpful user community.
    https://itk.org/

- The Templatized C++ Command Line Parser Library
    http://tclap.sourceforge.net/

These libraries were selected both because they are useful and because they have BSD/MIT style licenses.

All of the libraries will be automatically downloaded and installed during the compilation of the FLAWS-Tools software. An option is available for the user that would prefer to use their own version of ITK to build the code (See the build instructions).

## Build instructions

FLAWS-Tools C++ programs are available as a superproject. To build these programs, you must follow the next instructions:
- Clone the FLAWS-Tools repository from GitHub (git clone https://github.com/jerbeaumont/FLAWS-Tools.git).
- Create a folder named "build" in the folder FLAWS-Tools.
- Run CMake in the new build folder. If you wish to change the default compilation (which automatically downloads and compiles all dependencies and tools), use ccmake.
- Build using your environment (building works with make or ninja).

An example of command lines to build FLAWS-Tools is provided below (to run in the folder in which you want to install FLAWS-Tools):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jerbeaumont/FLAWS-Tools.git
cd FLAWS-Tools
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```
